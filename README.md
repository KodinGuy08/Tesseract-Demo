# Tesseract-Demo

The aim of this project is to build a tool that shows the capabilities of Tesseract. I have built a Qt UI to allow users to tesseract


## How to setup (Linux-only)

The following prerequisites are required:

```bash
sudo apt install libtesseract-dev
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
sudo apt install python3-opencv
```

Then we'd also need the following python dependecies:

```bash
pip install pytesseract
pip install PySide6
pip install Pillow
```
